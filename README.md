# Introduction

Self-hosted single-user Quiz app. The motivation for this project was that I wanted complete control of a quiz app; the code as well as the data. There are other self hosted alternatives such as [Scholarsome](https://www.scholarsome.com/) or the mighty [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and they are great apps, but I wanted a fully personalized app suited to my needs.

Lastly, I have written a [diary](https://github.com/ncmcodes/diary) and a notes app and wanted some sort of integration between these three apps in the future.
